# Conversational Pythonic ChatBot
Conversational Pythonic ChatBot is chatbot for WhatsApp using the Twilio API for WhatsApp and the Flask framework for Python. 

# What is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is a software application that is able to conduct a conversation with a human user through written or spoken language. The level of “intelligence” among chatbots varies greatly. While some chatbots have a fairly basic understanding of language, others employ sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve an almost human conversational level.

# Requirements

```
## Python 3.6 or newer:
If your operating system does not provide a Python interpreter, you can go to python.org to download an installer.

## Flask:
We will create a web application that responds to incoming WhatsApp messages with it.

## ngrok:
We will use this handy utility to connect the Flask application running on your system to a public URL that Twilio can connect to. This is necessary for the development version of the chatbot because your computer is likely behind a router or firewall, so it isn’t directly reachable on the Internet. If you don’t have ngrok it installed, you can download a copy for Windows, MacOS or Linux.

## A smartphone:
with an active phone number and WhatsApp installed.

## A Twilio account:
If you are new to Twilio create a free account now. You can review the features and limitations of a free Twilio account.
